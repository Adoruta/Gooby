# Gooby
Use Google Drive to create an infinite Plex or Emby on a VPS.
Please check the Tutorial: [Infinite Plex on VPS](http://bit.ly/TechPerplexed "How to create an infinite media server using a VPS and Cloud service")  
## Installation
Run with this command:  
`sudo wget http://bit.ly/GetGooby -O /tmp/install.sh && sudo bash /tmp/install.sh`
## Features
One click installation of Rclone, Plex, Tautulli, Emby, Sonarr, Radarr, Deluge, NZBGet, Jackett, Netdata, Organizr and Ombi.

NEW! Completely rewritten from scratch - I strongly advise to install this on a freshly installed VPS!
